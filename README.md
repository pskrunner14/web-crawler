# web-crawler

This is a Web Crawler implementation written in [GOLANG](https://golang.org/).

## Getting Started

Once you have [GOLANG](https://golang.org/) on your system, you'll need to install a few dependencies:

```
~$ go get github.com/llimllib/loglevel
~$ go get golang.org/x/net/html
~$ go get golang.org/x/net/html/atom
```

After you're done with that, you can start crawling wherever you want:

```
~$ go run main.go <URL>
```
